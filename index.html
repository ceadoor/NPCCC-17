                                        and money. We utilise these factors for a better living, but ultimately our time
                                        effort and money are benefitted by some other person or an establishment. A

                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

                                    luxuries and benefits. All that is lacking in today’s world is time. People

                                    cannot even spare a minute waiting for anything. In this context,

                                    with a brand right from the manufacturing period. 80% of the products

                                    made do not need any infrastructure at the time of production. Such

                                    products are bought directly from makers and given a brand name that

                                    adds to the face value of the product. Branding is a way of showing the

                                    customer what can be expected from a product that you offer how the

                                    product is different from the rest. By knowing the customer needs

                                    correctly, branding can be taken up as a successful business.                                </p>

                                    Great ideas are all around us. All we

                                    need is to pay attention to the world, watch and listen. Every project

                                    starts with a discovery. Invention is related to innovation where new

                                    ideas are successfully introduced to the market. Invention needs

                                    investment of time and money. The first step to invention is identifying

                                    the problem that needs solution and imagination to resolve the

                                    problem for the better. Recognising that one product used in a

                                    particular environment can be used somewhere else also caters to

                                    invention. Invention oriented business needs the ability to execute the

                                    details of your invention and make and sell the invention for profit.                               </p>

                                    Mostly companies prefer to create their

                                    own products and services and then market and sell for profit. In

                                    certain cases, a distribution or franchise agreement works best in order

                                    to sell the product in a better way. A distributor is a company that buys

                                    products from a producer and sells it. A distributor often operates

                                    under its own business name. A franchise is where a party (franchisee)

                                    purchases the right to market the product under the trademark of the

                                    producer (franchisor). Distribution and franchise is an area of business

                                    that needs less amount of risk as there is no need to market a product

                                    from scratch and can take advantage of a steady built in clientele.                                </p>
